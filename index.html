        <p>
          No matter how hard I try You keep pushing me aside And I can't break
          through There's no talking to you It's so sad that you're leaving It
          takes time to believe it But after all is said and done You're gonna
          be the lonely one Do you believe in life after love? I can feel
          something inside me saying I really don't think you're strong enough,
          no Do you believe in life after love? I can feel something inside me
          say I really don't think you're strong enough, no What am I supposed
          to do? Sit around and wait for you? Well, I can't do that And there's
          no turning back
